        <h2>Undergraduate in Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology</h2>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>When I reached my freshman year of high school, I realized that my small hometown education in rural Alaska was holding me back. I made the decision to attend and graduate from Mt. Edgecumbe High School, a state run boarding school in Southeast Alaska. I now attend Rochester Institute of Technology as a freshman in Computer Science currently in transition into Web and Mobile Computing</p>

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>In my high school years, I kept myself extremely involved in a number of clubs and organizations ranging from a local radio program to student government; sitting on the school board as a student representative. I ran cross-country for three seasons, fulfilling the role of team captain my senior year. Nowadays, I run a show on the local radio station, I make use of our on campus rock climbing gym, and set some time aside to train for my summer job in front end development, specifically web apps.     In my free time, I enjoy running, DJing, sitting in cafes, and various forms of wanderlust.</p>
